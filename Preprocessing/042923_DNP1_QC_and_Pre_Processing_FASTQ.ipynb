Additionally, we applied Scrublet (Wolock et al., 2019 link text) to identify potential doublets. The doublet score for each single cell and the threshold based on the bimodal distribution was calculated using default parameters. The expected doublet rate was set to be 0.08, and cells predicted to be doublets or with doubletScore larger than 0.25 were filtered. After quality control, a total of 1,598,708 cells were remained.\n",

Here, we first load the count matrix using Scanpy's read_text function. We then normalize the data using the normalize_total function, which scales the counts for each cell so that they have the same total count (in this case, 10,000). We then scale the data by cell-specific size factors using the scale function, and logarithmically transform the data using the log1p function."
